            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have joyned your ſword to ours, Preachers and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together; one hath need of another; we to pray for you, you to fight for us; being humm'd at by a company of Browniſts as we walk the ſtreets; whoſe very cloaks which we buy of them, they hate upon our backs. <hi>Pudet haec opprobrie nobis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Sermon, I heare, hath undergone ſome cenſure, (but by the weaker ſexe) for reciting Stories in it, as it is ſaid; but they which ſpake it, conſidered not that I was to ſpeak to Gentlemen that are both Souldiers and Scholars, and not to women, who are now grown ſuch learned Doctreſſes, that they will take upon them to teach any Miniſter both what and how to preach. An over-ſhooting expectation is an enemy to all honourable actions; and where that is not ſatisfied, the undertaker ſuffereth diſgrace. From me therefore ſeeing nothing of worth can be expected, I cannot ſuffer much in my reputation, if I have done that which is worth nothing: Yet as it is, I am bold to preſent it to your view, being in a manner enforced thereunto: For though your deſires were command enough, yet there is required a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of my ſelfe, and you; Of my ſelfe, that the world may ſee my doctrine and preaching is not ſo hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodoxall, as the malicious would make it; Of you, that mine enemies may ſee your judgement hath not ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="tcp:157079:5"/>erred in making choice of one, not altogether ſo unworthy as their envy reports me. It would trouble me, ſaid <hi>Seneca</hi> upon like occaſion, if <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or the other <hi>Scipio</hi> did thus cenſure me: <hi>Nunc malis diſplicere laudari eſt,</hi> 'Tis praiſe to be diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of thoſe that ſpeak ill, who never yet learned to doe well. They are like bawling dogs, (ſaith he) <hi>qui non feritate, ſed pro conſuetudine latrant,</hi> that bark more for cuſtome then curſtneſſe. However, ſuch as it is I preſent to you and the worlds view. I can make it no better then it is, and if others will make it worſe, yet my hope is you will make the beſt of it. Finally (worthy Gentlemen) Feare God, honour the King, be religious in peace, be valiant in war, fight the good fight of faith, <hi>Agonotheta Deus,</hi> God the Lord of battailes hath promiſed you <hi>immarceſſibilem coronam,</hi> a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading crowne, and triumph in his Kingdome.

            <p n="1">1. The Preachers: From whence I note the glory of the Miniſterie in us; for though we be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157079:7"/>made <hi>Spectaculum,</hi> a gazing ſtock to the Angels, to the world, and to men, yet Vs, <hi>He cauſeth us to triumph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Hearers: From whence I note the comfort that comes to you; for ſeeing your good is the cauſe of our joy, you alſo are Actors in this Triumph; We rejoycing in your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, You, in our Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Author is God, he <hi>cauſeth</hi> us, for ſeeing neither we nor you have cauſe to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in our ſelves; Not we, for we are onely Gods Labourers; Not you, for ye are Gods Husbandry: Therefore He whoſe Labourers we are, whoſe Husbandry ye are, he cauſeth us to triumph; We for you, you by us, both in Chriſt, <hi>He cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the time of continuance, how long it laſteth; Not like the Pageants or triumphs of the world, a tedious toile, and a quick ſpoile, ſet up in a yeare, and pulled downe in a day; not <hi>per annos,</hi> for a few yeares, but <hi>perennis,</hi> for ever, <hi>Alwayes he cauſeth us to triumph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, then follows a Thankſgiving, like the ſhout of an Army after a victory, like that of Iſrael, when the Arke of God came into the Hoſte, <hi>Now thanks be to God which alwayes cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Preachers of the Word of God are Actors, He cauſeth us to triumph. Our triumph ſtands in three things: Watching, Feeding, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering: And for theſe the Church is compared to a City, to a Flock, to a Bride. To a City,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157079:8"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. whereof they are watchmen, <hi>Eſay</hi> 21. To a flock, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and they are the Shepherds. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. To a Bride, and they are the <hi>Paranymphi,</hi> the friends of the Bride-chamber, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. Three things therefore are due from them to the Church, <hi>Munimenta, Alimenta, Ornamenta,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard:</hi> As ſhe is a City, ſhe muſt be watcht for her ſafety; As a Flock, ſhe muſt be fed of neceſſity; As a Bride, ſhe muſt be ordered with decency. In theſe ſtands our triumph.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore ye ſhall ſee a deſcription of this City, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. It was all of gold, it had a great wall, and high, twelve gates, three Eaſt, three Weſt, three North, and three South, and it lay foure ſquare. To this heavenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the Church may be compared, <hi>Cujus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus concordia, antemurale patientia. Bern. in dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. Eccleſiae.</hi> Vnity of the Citizens is the wall, for <hi>Civitas eſt civium unitas;</hi> a good conſcience and patience are the Bulwarks. It is called holy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe eſtabliſhed in the holineſſe of faith; It is new, becauſe the Law dies, the Ceremonies fade: The Law, like old <hi>Zachary,</hi> is dumb, and cannot ſpeak, becauſe <hi>Iohn,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Grace,</hi> is borne. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.20. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, all things are become new. New hearts, Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>New tongues, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>A new commandement, Iohn</hi> 13. It is called <hi>Hieruſalem the viſion of peace,</hi> for Chriſt the Founder of it, and confounder of the enemies of it, is our peace. The twelve gates reſemble the twelve Articles of our faith, through confeſſion whereof we enter into the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157079:8"/>Church. The foure parts of the world ſhew the amplitude thereof. Laſtly, this City lyeth foure ſquare, which is a reſemblance of our faith, love, hope, and good works. They are all of one length: for how much a man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, ſo much he hopeth; what he hopeth, he loveth; and as he loveth, he worketh: And thus (as ſaith the Prophet) <hi>thou ſhalt be called a City ſought out and not forſaken, Eſay</hi> 62.12.</p>
            <p>But now, ſaith the Preacher, <hi>I have ſeene this wiſdome under the ſun, A little City, and few men in it, and a great King came and compaſſed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and builded Forts againſt it: And there was found therein a poore and wiſe man, and he delivered this City by his wiſdome, but none remembred this poore man: Then ſaid I, Better is wiſdome then weapons of war, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.14. But I know not how, this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is betrayed, there is a conſpiracie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the midſt of her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. and a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy of the people, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. I meane Ieſuites and Separatiſts, they craftily crept in to ſpie out our liberty, theſe have wickedly gone out to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray our peace; not content to drink of the ſweet waters, but trouble the reſidue with their feet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.17. yea like ſo many <hi>Saepiaes</hi> have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited forth Inke, with too much gall in it, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe our Churches peace, and daſh our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. I wiſh there had not been men ariſing out of our ſelves, ſpeaking perverſe things, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. For as the ſea would be quiet of it ſelfe, if winds, and vapours, and exhalations did not trouble it; ſo the people would have been tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:157079:9"/>and peaceable enough, if ſome ſeditious Orators, the bluſtring brethren of <hi>Boreas,</hi> had not ſet them in agitation.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ioab</hi> underſtood that his enemies were encamped both before and behind him, he divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Army betweene himſelfe and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> with this direction, <hi>If the Aramites be ſtronger then I, thou ſhalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too hard for thee, I will come and ſuccour thee.</hi> Let us doe ſo: and like thoſe in <hi>Peters</hi> ſhip that beckoned to their fellows in <hi>Andrews</hi> boat, aid one another againſt the common adverſary. They write of Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Counteſſe of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, that the would often ſay, On condition that the Princes of Chriſtendome would combine themſelves, and march againſt the common enemy the Turk, ſhe would moſt willingly attend them, and be their Laundreſſe in the Camp. God unite us at home among our ſelves, that the ſeameleſſe coat of Chriſt, rent by ſchiſme and faction, may be made up, that ſo we may triumph in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church is a flock, and muſt be fed of neceſſity, and in this alſo ſtands our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. <hi>Feed, feed, feed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter: Earth, earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> for that is your food: You are thrice called upon to heare, we thrice called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toteach, ſhewing thereby that your joy and our triumph are both twiſted upon one threed: <hi>O ter foelices &amp; amplius quos irrupta tenet copula, nec malis divulſus queremoniis extrema citius ſolvet amor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:157079:9"/>die,</hi> as he ſaid of man and wife. Thrice happy ſhall we and you be, if our unity be not divided with unjuſt complaints, if our love to Chriſt be mutuall, and our care to ſerve him equall. <hi>The Prieſts lips,</hi> ſaith the Lord in <hi>Malachy, ſhall preſerve knowledge, and they ſhall ſeek the Law at his mouth, Mal.</hi> 2.7. The reaſon there is given, <hi>For he is a meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> which teacheth us and you our duties: Firſt us, He is <hi>a Meſſenger,</hi> that requireth fidelity; <hi>a meſſenger of the Lord,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſanctity; <hi>of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth magnanimity. Secondly, you: <hi>A Meſſenger,</hi> therefore you muſt give him audience; <hi>of the Lord,</hi> therefore yeeld him obedience; <hi>of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> therefore you owe him reverence.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to think that our Church ſhould be troubled with two cruell mothers: One hath dry breaſts, and yet will needs be a Nurſe; wanteth knowledge, yet will have a charge: Another hath flowing breaſts, yet will give no ſuck; hath learning enough, but will take no paines. Now both are bad, and hinder your joy, and our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. <hi>We have a little ſiſter, and ſhe hath no breaſts, what ſhall we doe for our ſiſter when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for? Cant.</hi> 8. Nay indeed, how can we ſpeak for our ſiſter when ſhe ſhould be done for? and therefore one is oftentimes the puniſhment of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: for they who through wilfull ſloth have dryed up their breaſts, God gives them a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wombe that they cannot conceive. <hi>Give them, O Lord, what wilt thou give them? Give them a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wombe, and dry breaſts, Hoſ.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Doſt thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157079:10"/>love me?</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Feed, feed, feed.</hi> This is the ſecond part of our triumph.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Church is a Bride, and muſt be ordered with decency. It is true, as <hi>Clem. Alexand.</hi> ſaith, her chiefeſt ornament is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with the ornament of goodneſſe, for <hi>the Kings daughter is all glorious within,</hi> and without too, <hi>her garments are of wrought gold.</hi> There is therefore ſome outward beauty which the Church hath, comely Ceremonies, void of ſuperſtitious abuſe, which ſerve to edifying, and preſervation of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and order; for if there were none at all, it would bring in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Will-worſhip, and every one after his owne fancie would faſhion new formes of behaviour; We ſhould have as many factions as fancies, and as many Goſpels as Goſſips.</p>
            <p>Againe, if there ſhould be too many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that would induce <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuperſtition; and through multiplicity, men might be turned from the ſimplicity of Gods true worſhip: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are not many, to keep us from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; but ſome, to keep us in order. We all call for reformation, but of miſ-governors, not change of government. Is there no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent drunkenneſſe, but by digging up the Vines?</p>
            <p>I grieve to think on them which exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this triumph which wee have in Chriſt, becauſe they leave our Church; and the Church doth well to leave them that have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe the walls of peace: Yet I could wiſh, that though they be without the walls, they may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:157079:10"/>be within the Liberties, but that the Liberties go no farther then the Bars of Order, and theſe Bars have they broken alſo. Well, Chriſt is the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, the Church is the Bride, ſhe muſt have her peacefull ornaments: Yet as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sunt qui te etiam per ornamenta ferient;</hi> That which is ſome part of our Churches glory, there be that wreſt it to her ſhame: of whom I will ſay no more, but <hi>O miſeram Sponſam talibus concreditam Paranym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis! I rejoyce,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, beholding your order, Col.</hi> 2.5. and he gave commandement that all things ſhould be done <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>decently and in order. Gal.</hi> 6.16. the Apoſtle exhorts to walk in rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a military march, which requireth order: And the Church is compared to a well ordered Army, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. <hi>Who is this that looketh forth as the morning, faire as the moone, pure as the ſun, terrible as an Army with banners, acies ordinata.</hi> God is the God of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and wicked men are noted by the Apoſtle to be ſuch as are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that walk diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and therefore all that are enemies to good order, let them take heed of that place, <hi>Where there is no order, Iob</hi> 10.22. We ſhould be like ſo many beames, ſhining from one Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; like ſo many brooks derived from one fountaine of Grace, ſweetly united, orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: for the Churches glory conſiſts in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Feeding, Ordering, and in that ſhe trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth, <hi>Now thanks be to God which cauſeth us to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee how we that are Preachers, are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157079:11"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:157079:12"/>Actors in this triumph, but yet not without you that are hearers; we triumph in you, and you by us, both in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For <hi>Natura noſtra eſt, Ordinatio autem veſtra:</hi> Our nature, as men, is our own; our Ordination, as Miniſters, is yours: If we live well, it is our gaine; if we teach well, it is your gaine: and like the Angels in <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, are alwayes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending or deſcending: When they aſcend, they informe the judgement of the learned; when they deſcend, they ſpeak to the capacity of the ſimple. <hi>Aſcendunt, ut erigant magnos; deſcendunt, ut nutriant parvos.</hi> See how S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſcends, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Whether we be beſides our ſelves, we are it unto God:</hi> See how he deſcends, <hi>Or whether we be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we are it unto you;</hi> becauſe <hi>Sancti excedunt in contemplatione, ſobrii ſunt in praedicatione. Paul</hi> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when he ſaid, <hi>We ſpeak wiſdome to the perfect:</hi> He deſcended, when he ſaid, <hi>I gave you milk, not meat.</hi> How ever it be, we eſteeme you a great part of our triumph, for we preach Chriſt Ieſus and our ſelves your ſervants for Ieſus ſake.</p>
            <p>How comes, it then, that we are ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued in our preaching? What comfort can we have, when prejudice precludes your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For though we paſſe not for mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we ſee it to be a daily conſequent of our labours, to be judged as often as we ſpeak. If we come in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, it is accounted weaknes; if we reprove their ſin, they ſay we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our Text: <hi>Art thou here mine enemy?</hi> ſaith one, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. <hi>What ſaid this mad fellow?</hi> ſaith another.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:157079:12"/>Thus whilſt we, like birds of the morning, record the praiſes of God, one or other that hath bent his tongue like a bow, lies ready to ſhoot out his arrows, even bitter words.</p>
            <p>Wherefore beloved, ſeeing wee deſire to have you partners of our triumph, ſee that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, and fulfill our joy: <hi>For what is our joy, or crowne of rejoycing? are not even you it at the preſence of the comming of the Lord Ieſus?</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19. Yes, you are our glory, and our joy. <hi>Now thanks be to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now worthy Gentlemen and Souldiers, I muſt neglect you no longer, whom having ſpoken to as Chriſtians, I muſt now exhort as Military men, for you I behold this day in a triumphant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the joy and honour of this City. You have been taught by others, the cauſes of undertaking a War to be three: Neceſſary defence, due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and reparation of dammage. But that ye may conquer and triumph, I ſhall commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you theſe three vertues, Piety, Iuſtice, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Piety,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is profitable for all things, it hath the promiſes of this life, and that that is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Other vertues without this, are like force and agility in the body without eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, nature without grace; like blind <hi>Sampſon</hi> without a guide. All that which we call Vertue, if it be not directed by the feare of God, and true godlineſſe, are names void of the things. What is prudence without it but a childiſh dexterity, by which every one reſolves of his actions, as hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:157079:13"/>is a Lawyer, a Merchant, a Scholar, but not as he is a man? ſo being wiſe in the retaile, he may be a foole in groſſe. Valour without it, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into ambitious deſperateneſſe, and hardens a mans courage to miſchiefe: And temperance without godlineſſe is rather a Diet then a Vertue; a meere abſtinence for Healths ſake, not a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Religions ſake.</p>
            <p>Piety therefore is neceſſary for all men, and for a Souldier not leaſt of all; for he that goes forth every day to hazard his life, had need be prepared for a good paſſage: Therefore ſaith God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9. <hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt the enemie, take heed of every wicked thing.</hi> A man muſt be at peace with God, before he fight with his enemies. When <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> heard War pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt him, it is ſaid that <hi>he feared; and ſet himſelfe to ſeek the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. It was <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurions honour, a brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that <hi>he was a juſt man, and feared God.</hi> It is he that muſt be ſought in the firſt place, for <hi>The horſe is prepared for the day of battaile, but ſafety or victory is of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 21.31. When <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi> fought in the valley, <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed in the Mount: When he held up his hand, <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and when he let fall his hand, <hi>Amalek</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.9. He that will conquer, muſt obſerve this rule, <hi>Armanda mens fide, manus prece, vita caſtis moribus:</hi> He muſt have his mind armed with faith, his hand with prayer, his life with chaſte manners.</p>
            <p>Would you triumph then Gentlemen? with a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:157079:13"/>faithfull confidence truſt in God: <hi>Some truſt in Chariots, and ſome in Horſes, but we will truſt in the Name of the Lord,</hi> ſaid the beſt Warriour of the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.8. for the Lord God is he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to fight for you, againſt your enemies, to ſave you. When <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond was at S. <hi>Davids</hi> in Wales, and from the cliffes in a cleere day diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſaid, <hi>If it be no farther, I with my Ships am able to make a bridge thither:</hi> Which ſpeech being realted to <hi>Murchard,</hi> King of <hi>Leniſter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he demanded if the King added not <hi>with the grace of God:</hi> when it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he made no mention of God, then ſaid he more cheerfully, <hi>I feare him the leſſe, that truſteth more to himſelfe then Gods help.</hi> We cannot overcome, unleſſe we fight under Chriſts ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; No conquering, no triumphing without Piety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How can the War be religious, if not juſt? the Conquerours ſword ought to be ſwayed with the arme of Iuſtice: it is that which meaſures out right to men by equall proportion, and to be exerciſed even towards our enemies: it is that which guards vertue, and combats vice. When the Souldiers came to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and demanded of him, <hi>And what ſhall we doe? Luke</hi> 3.13. he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Doe violence to no man, accuſe not falſely, be content with your wages.</hi> I have read, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane warfare was a Schoole of Vertue. <hi>Aurelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Emperour gave this charge to his <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Militum,</hi> Vpon thy life, ſayes he, contain the hands of thy ſouldiers; ſuffer them not ſo much
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:157079:14"/>as to kill a chicken, or pull a grape of another mans; oyle, or ſalt, or wood let none exact, but be content <hi>annona ſua,</hi> with his allowance: <hi>De praeda hoſtis, non de lachrymis provincialium habeat,</hi> Let them take of the ſpoils of the enemy, but not live by the tears of their Countrymen. See a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to this purpoſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 20.17. when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent meſſengers from Kadeſh to the men of Edom, he obſerved this order: <hi>Let us paſſe I pray thee through thy Country: we will not paſſe through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will goe by the Kings high way, we will not turne to the right hand or to the left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Iuſtice therefore may be preſerved, not onely violence and oppreſsion, but all beaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge muſt be avoided; men muſt not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, but againſt enemies: Therefore God commanded his Souldiers <hi>not to cut downe trees bearing fruit:</hi> becauſe (ſaith one) <hi>lignum eſt, &amp; non homo, nec poteſt bellantium contra nos augere numerum:</hi> They are wood, not man, and cannot encreaſe the number of enemies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.19. It was a good anſwer of <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> a Spartan Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> hath it) who being accuſed for yeelding up the towne <hi>Bizantium</hi> committed to his charge, he anſwered, As long as he fought with men, he defended it, but when he ſaw he was to fight with nature, and that they periſht with famine whom men ſpare in war, he thought good to give it up. <hi>Tully</hi> was an excellent man of Law, and knowing what Iuſtice was, would have the Sword give place to the Gowne. It were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:157079:14"/>a note of excellent modeſty, and might be aſſumed, but how? as greater Hoſts in their owne houſes give precedencie to meaner gueſts, or as we ſay of doting parents, they are content to be made fooles by the wit of their children: but to aſcribe it as a due or right, he thinks not right, for the Gowne can but meditate, and ſay, In Iuſtice this ought to be done, when the Sword ſaith, For Iuſtice ſake this is done. Be juſt and triumph.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You muſt have Fortitude, elſe Iuſtice is weak: it is not poſſible to triumph without that. It is a Probleme in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> why Fortitude ſhould raiſe more admiration then Iuſtice, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Temperance: We are not ſo affected with wonder when we ſee theſe, as when we behold a valiant Captain, or brave Commander, he anſwereth it thus: Becauſe the object of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and exerciſe of it, conſiſts onely in the moderation of pleaſure; of Prudence, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Civill affaires; of Iuſtice, in giving <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um cuique,</hi> every man his owne: but Fortitude, the proper Vertue of a Souldier, hath for its object Victory, which cannot be had without blowes and wounds, danger and dint of Sword. A Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier dares march againſt death, and out face it, which others tremble to think on. This renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them above all other arts, for they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with quiet ſtudy, warme caſe, and ſound reſt; but the Souldier finds difficulty in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and danger in his attempts, whereas co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are the ſcorne of men, and contemptible,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:157079:15"/>as having nothing of price but their lives, ſcarce that, nor any thing wiſe but their feares.</p>
            <p>You ſhall know a valiant man by this, He is undaunted when he encountreth force, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when he meets with weakneſſe and diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The juſter that wrath is, the more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable is mercy. One writes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of France, when he might have hewed the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians in pieces, puts downe his Piſtoll, and ſaves them, ſaying, He would not ſuffer them to take harme, who were not in caſe to doe any. <hi>Tiberius</hi> would not take away the life of his enemie by treachery, and told the Prince of the Celts, that Rome had a ſword to kill with, and not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries box.</p>
            <p>When revenge lies in a mans hand, the uſuall way to appeaſe, is by ſubmiſſion and entreaty: yet ſometime reſolution and courage doth that which ſubmiſſion cannot doe: As that valiant Prince of <hi>Epirus, Scanderbeg,</hi> following a ſouldier to kill him; when the ſouldier ſaw that no means of humility would mollifie his Captaine, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at laſt to encounter him with his ſword: This brave reſolution ſtaid his fury, whom he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave, but received into favour. Our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries write of <hi>Iohn Beaufort,</hi> Earle of Dorſet, with fifteene hundred men, being encompaſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſea with fifteene thouſand French, <hi>Arminac</hi> the Generall of the French ſent to him, and adviſed him to yeeld: But he anſwered, It is not the manner of the Engliſh to yeeld without blows, neither am I ſo heartleſſe as to deliver my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:157079:15"/>ſelfe into their hands, whom God may deliver into mine: And accordingly it came to paſſe, God gave him the honour of the day.</p>
            <p>It was Gods charge to <hi>Ioſhua, Onely be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and of a good courage:</hi> See that in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he was adviſed to hide himſelfe in the Temple to ſave his life, <hi>Should ſuch a man as I fly?</hi> ſaith he: <hi>And who is he that being as I am, would goe into the Temple to ſave his life? I will not goe in, Nehem.</hi> 6.11. When the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el began to mutiny, having heard of Gyants and Anakims in the Land of Canaan, <hi>Come, let us make a Captaine, and returne into Egypt, Num.</hi> 13.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.9. but <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> ſtilled the people, ſaying, <hi>Feare not the people of the land, they are bread for us, their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us, feare them not.</hi> What a triumphant exploit was that of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 6.43. perceiving that one of the beaſts was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with royall harneſſe, he made a lane through his enemies with his ſword to approach that Elephant, and creeping under him, wounded him in the belly; and with the fall of the beaſt being cruſht to death, <hi>ſuo ſepultus eſt triumphe,</hi> was buried in his owne triumph, or rather tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in his owne buriall. <hi>Syracides</hi> ſaith of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he plaid with Lions as with Kids, and with Beares as Lambs, Syr.</hi> 47.3. Valiant ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers armed with divine fortitude, <hi>Tam alacres ad interitum quam ad triumphum rapiuntur,</hi> are carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as cheerfully to their death, as to a triumph:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:157079:16"/>
               <hi>quam glorioſi revertuntur victores de praelio, tam beati moriuntur Martyres in praelio:</hi> From the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile they returne glorious Conquerours, in the battaile they die bleſſed Martyrs. Whatſoever happens in a juſt Warre, the Souldier is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: If conquer, with a triumphant Garland; if vanquiſhed, with a Martyrs crowne. <hi>Securus interimit, ſecurior interit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard:</hi> he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not when he kils, nor periſheth when he dies.</p>
            <p>The way to attaine to this Fortitude, is, to keepe a good conſcience. Nothing makes a man ſo much a coward, as the guilt of ſinne. When <hi>David</hi> had loſt his holineſſe, how faint-hearted he became! He that played with Lyons and Beares like Lambs and Kids, runs away from his owne ſonne: being diſarmed of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>Factus eſt in peccato timidus, qui fuerat in gratia metuendus:</hi> Whom the ſtate of grace found valiantly active, the guilt of ſin made fearfully fugitive. There is no way but this to conquer, and it muſt be by this, if ye deſire to triumph. <hi>Now thanks be to God, who cauſeth us:</hi> And ſo I come to the Author.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is the Author of all the good we doe; it is he that worketh, <hi>velle &amp; perficere;</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not triumph but by him: The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battaile to the ſtrong. When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> returned victorious, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> met him, and gave God the glory, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, who hath delivered thine enemies into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:157079:16"/>thine hand:</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> told the King of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>I will not take ſo much as a ſhooe-latchet of thee.</hi> S. <hi>Chryfoſtome</hi> giveth two reaſons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he acknowledged God to be the giver of victory. As if he ſhould ſay, I brought nothing to this War, but <hi>voluntatem &amp; promptitudinem,</hi> a prompt and willing mind; <hi>Victoriam &amp; trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum operatus eſt Deus,</hi> The victory and triumph is the Lords. 2. That the King of Sodome might not arrogate the glory of his riches to himſelfe, but to God: As if <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſaid, I have God that enricheth me, keep thy gifts to thy ſelfe, he is my <hi>buckler</hi> and my <hi>exceeding great reward:</hi> a <hi>buckler</hi> to defend me, a <hi>reward</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>David</hi> laid up the ſword of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> in the Tabernacle of God, thereby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging God to be the Author of his victory. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi> built an Altar unto the Lord of whole ſtones, over which no man had lift up an iron, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 8.31. The reaſon is given by a Rabbin, that the good which men obtaine by their prayers, they are beholden to no hand for but the hand of heaven. <hi>I am able to doe all things,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>through the help of him that ſtrengtheneth me, Phil.</hi> 4. to fight, to overcome, and all in Chriſt: <hi>Nihil poſſum a meipſo, omnia poſſum in eo,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>To him that overcommeth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will grant to ſit in my Throne, even as I overcame, and ſit with my Father in his Throne, Apoc.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>Obſerve how S. <hi>Paul</hi> triumphed in thoſe ſcars which he received for Chriſt; <hi>I beare about in my
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:157079:17"/>body,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the marks of the Lord Ieſus, tanquam aliquod trophaeum.</hi> Wounds received by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Lords cauſe, how honourable are they! <hi>Paphnutius</hi> having had his right eye put out for the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour would often call him into the Palace; and as if he ſucked a bleſſing from thoſe ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, would cheriſh the diſgraced place with kiſſes. S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> profeſſeth, he had rather be like <hi>Peter,</hi> a priſoner for Chriſt, then like the Angel that ſet him at liberty. Our triumphs are in ſuffering, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. more then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>The world, I confeſſe, hath her triumphs alſo, but not in Chriſt; yea Chriots, and pomp of triumphs, like the Chariots of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gods people. Shall I crave leave to preſent before you a ſhort view of two or three of them? Firſt, Malice, mounted upon a Chariot, runs upon the wheeles of miſchiefe, cruelty, raſhneſſe, impatience, &amp; impudence; drawn along with two fierce beaſts, Secular pompe, and Carnall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; fed like <hi>Diomedes</hi> horſes, with the fleſh of men: <hi>A generation</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>whoſe teeth are ſwords, and their jawes, knives to eat up the afflicted, and the poore from among men, Prov.</hi> 30.14. God is no Author of this triumph.</p>
            <p>Next, Luxury hath her Chariot that runnes riot; they drive like <hi>Iehu,</hi> as if they were mad; wheeled with Gluttony, Luſt, Pride, and Sloth; drawne along with two pampered and high-fed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:157079:17"/>horſes, Plenty and Proſperity; Oblivion the Coach-man.</p>
            <p>After theſe comes Covetouſneſſe, warily moving; her Chariot hung all with iron hooks, running upon foure wheeles, Puſillanimity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, Inhumanity, Forgetfulneſſe of death; her horſes, like her ſelfe, ſpare and leane, called <hi>Tenacitas</hi> and <hi>Rapacitas,</hi> Greedy to catch, and Loth to forgoe; raind up with the bridle of Holding faſt, and whipt on with a Deſire of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the Devils and the Worlds Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, their end is <hi>Praecipices,</hi> and downfalls: for they that climbe by privie ſinne, ſhall fall with open ſhame. <hi>Thou, O man of God,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, fly theſe things.</hi> It is our glory that are Preachers, to win ſoules; it is your comfort. We cannot triumph without you, nor you without us. What a joy will it be at that great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, when we ſhall returne our poore talents with advantage! When <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall lead in triumph after him <hi>Iury; Andrew</hi> leading <hi>Achaia; Iohn, Aſia; Paul</hi> triumphing with a world of ſouls after him: and ſome of us, I hope, triumphing with ſome of you. <hi>Now thanks be to God which cauſeth us in Chriſt.</hi> But if this triumph be not conſtant, where is our comfort? It followeth therefore in the next place, the continuance of time,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Alwayes</hi> he cauſeth us to triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alwayes in Chriſt,</hi> for he having triumphed over death and hell, doth lead Captivity ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:157079:18"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he hath unlooſed the ſorrows of death; ſo we in him doe alwayes triumph: A good conſcience is a continuall feaſt; the Comforter abideth with us for ever; it is ever working: For as the creatures of God do alwayes continue their actions to which Nature enclines them, The fire alwayes burneth, if it have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter combuſtible; the heavens alwayes moving, except by an Almighty power commanded to ſtand; the Sun alwayes ſhining, though clouds obfuſcate his bright beams to us, yet ever cleare in it ſelfe: So the righteous, whom God cauſeth to triumph in Chriſt, are alwayes moving in the ſpheare of Obedience, alwayes warming with the flames of Charity, alwayes ſhining with the bright beames of Sanctity. <hi>The Father hath not left me alone,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe I doe alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him, Iohn</hi> 8. ſo doe we in Chriſt: Alwayes hope, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. alwayes pray, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. alwayes give thanks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. alwayes rejoyce, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. alwayes burning, ſhining, and teaching, and ſo doing, alwayes triumphing.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> words, <hi>All the day long will I praiſe thee,</hi> hath this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: In proſperity, becauſe I find conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in adverſity, becauſe I feele thy mercifull correction: When I was loſt, thou foundſt me; when I ſinned, thou pardonedſt mee; when I returned, thou receivedſt me; when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, thou crownedſt me: For he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the end, giveth all things belonging
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:157079:18"/>to the end: The grace of inchoation, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin well; of continuation, to goe on well; of conſummation, to end well: <hi>Voluntatem praeparat adjuvandam, adjuvat praeparatam:</hi> He prepares the will that he may help it, and he helps it when he hath prepared it, and ſo he cauſeth us <hi>alwayes</hi> to triumph in Chriſt. Alwayes? <hi>Now thanks be to God.</hi> So I come to the laſt Part.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Thankſgiving. Amongſt the Iews were as many Thanks-offerings, as Offerings of Expiation and Atonement: To teach us, to be as thankfull for bleſſings received, as in our wants we are importunate to obtaine them. The excellencie of this ſervice would be conſidered, which is preferred by the Lord himſelfe before all ſacrifices; peculiar to Saints; the ſervice of the life to come, when all other almoſt ceaſe: it is all we are able to render. <hi>Non habeo niſi mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuta duo,</hi> Two mites is all I have, a ſoule and a body: <hi>Et ſi millies rependerem, quid ſum ego ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um?</hi> If I ſhould give my ſelfe a thouſand times, what am I to God? Nature it ſelfe teacheth this duty: The very ground payes back the coſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon it; <hi>Non ingratus ager:</hi> The Sunne drawes up vapour from the earth, ſends it back in raine. <hi>Vnde exeunt flumina, revertuntur ut iterum fluant:</hi> The rivers return to the ſea from whence they came. As in the Sun beames, the more their multiplication, the greater the reflection: ſo for Gods bleſſings ſhewed forth to you by his Miniſters in every place, the greater ſhould be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:157079:19"/>your fruitfulneſſe, the more your thankfulneſſe. <hi>Who cauſeth us alwayes to triumph in Chriſt. Now thanks be to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here me thinks I ſhould make an end, but that one thing is wanting to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our triumph, which preſents it ſelfe to our view this day: That is, to acknowledge the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of your triumphing, which are many.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In your Princely Generall, Patron and Protector of your Company, our Illuſtrious Prince CHARLES, of whom it may be ſaid, as of <hi>Titus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Veſpaſian, Delitiae humani generis:</hi> The honour of Armes, whoſe hopefull vertues are the food, life, and ſoule of Souldiers. In this we have cauſe to triumph.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the order, and ſplendour, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the united hearts and fellowſhip of your whole company: Though ye differ in your individuals, as ſo many ſeverall perſons, and perhaps in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet you make up together one compacted Body of an Army; and as touching your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, have but one ſoule: Like the foure Elements, though of oppoſite qualities, yet they meet harmoniouſly in a middle temper of mans conſtitution, <hi>&amp; concordi pace ligantur.</hi> In this wee have cauſe to triumph.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In your brave Commander, the Captaine of your Yard: Of whom I could ſay much, but that I feare to offend his modeſty, <hi>Et ne damnum illius laudibus mea faceret verecundia,</hi> Leſt my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty alſo might damnifie his due praiſes. Onely
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:157079:19"/>thus much, becauſe I will not ſinne againſt Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whilſt I am afraid to offend Modeſtie: If you deſire to be inſtructed in Militarie Diſcipline, accompanyed with religious mildneſſe, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſobriety, wiſe temperance, manly fortitude, I ſay no more, but Follow your Leader. In this we have cauſe to triumph.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the bounty of our generous Citizens, and noble Benefactors, who have begun a glorious work, your <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> your Field of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The Romanes had ſuch a place, which they called their great Schoole of defence. It was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the people by a Veſtall Virgin, <hi>Caia Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natia;</hi> but <hi>Tarquine</hi> the Proud, the laſt King of Rome, tooke it away from them, and converted it to his owne uſe, in ſowing corne there: Which corne, when he was depoſed, the Romanes threw into the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> judging it unfit, that any ſhould reap commodity from ſo holy ground: In proceſſe of time, the ſheaves of corne being ſtopt in a ſhallow Foord of the River, became firme ground, and was called <hi>The holy Iſland;</hi> and after the expulſion of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> this <hi>Campus Martius</hi> was reſtored to its former uſe, wherein they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Chivalrie, and feats of Armes. The like to this is yours; but never a proud <hi>Tarquine</hi> will ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate the uſe of that ſo happily begun.</p>
            <p>Goe on therefore ye worthy Citizens, finiſh your noble Schoole of Defence: If I have erred in commending you, ye will pardon my charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake. I did deliver freely what I thought
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:157079:20"/>you had done, or what I beleeved you ſhould have done, or what I hope you will doe. It is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to prepare for War. We have enjoyed peace a long time, (bleſſed be God) but that peace hath bred ſome ſurfets, which we pray God to cure with gentle purges, without letting bloud. <hi>Lipſius</hi> gave this to be the reaſon of our Halcyon dayes in <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> raign, <hi>Quodjam in pace Britannia, imperio debet pacati ſexus,</hi> We did owe our peace to that quiet and mild ſexe: And yet we have had, and ſtill have maſculine Princes, and ſtill enjoy peace, bleſſed be God; But what then? ſhall that lull us aſleep, and ſecure us from all Martiall meditation? becauſe the Summer quarter hangeth upon us, ſhall we think that Winter rots in the Skie? Goe on therefore, let not ſo glorious a work be hindered with faint-hearted avarice, but beſtow your bounty for their convenience, who will be ready to ſpend their bloud for your defence. In ancient times, when the Captaine returned from the Wars in trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant manner, he entred the City, <hi>Non apertis portis, ſed diſruptis muris,</hi> Not by opening the gates, but by making a large breach in their walls: To ſignifie, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that having ſo great and valiant Souldiers, they needed no walls to defend them: As <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>Achilles,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo theſe are the walls of the City. This is one of the glorious things that are ſpoken of thee, O City of London; and it muſt needs joy your hearts to ſee ſo many brave Worthies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:157079:20"/>iſſue out of your ſides, like the flower of Greece out of the Trojan horſe. In this alſo we have great cauſe to triumph. Now thanks be to God which cauſeth us to triumph thus on earth, even in this Church Militant, and the ſame God bring us at laſt to the Church triumphant in heaven, through the bleſſed merits of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father and the holy Spirit be aſcribed all honour, power and dominion, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
